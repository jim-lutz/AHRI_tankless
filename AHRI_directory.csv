# The Department of Energy (DOE) test procedure has been changed significantly. As a result, Energy Factor (EF) ratings are being replaced with Uniform Energy Factor (UEF) ratings. Currently this directory lists only models that were available before July 13, 2015, and their EF ratings.
# Models that have been introduced to the market on or after July 13, 2015 are required to use the revised test procedure and have a UEF rating. Those new models are viewable on a separate page here .
